# tcc_senai_modbus_scadabr_pic_c
A project developed for the technical faculty in industrial automation with current measurement communication via modbus for an open source scada (ScadaBR). Developed in C for PIC.

It's an unpretentious design, when a few peripherals multiplexer on a bus using buffering.
You can see the hardware board (pass through) in the following video:
